# Pokemon database SQL

This is a group project made by Tianne Lee, Andrew Chan and Terry Lin for UBC's CPSC 304 course, winter 2021 term 1.

## Project description:
Our product is a creative imagining of a prototype Pokédex. In this Pokédex, there are a series of tables that represent the people, Pokémon, and other aspects of the Pokémon world that the user has learned. In our project implementation, we have several tabs you can select, which each contain their own example functions that each use different types of SQL Queries to interact with the Pokédex.




### Addition information:

In addition to the required functions, we added "Display Titles of all Tables" and "Display Tuples in Requested Table" functions. Users can see all instances of all tables when using the "Display Tuples in Requested Table" option.

Changed Generation attribute gname from char to integer for easier comparison.

Pokedex.php modified from CPSC304 tutorial 7.
